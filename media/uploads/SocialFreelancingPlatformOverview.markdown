# Social Freelancing Platform Project Overview (Django Academic Project)

## Project Overview
The platform is a Django-based web application that blends LinkedIn-like social networking with freelancing project management. Users can register, create profiles, post updates (like LinkedIn posts), connect with other users, list and showcase projects, post project opportunities requiring candidates, and allow other users to apply for these opportunities. Users can also search for others based on skills. The platform is designed for academic purposes, demonstrating Django’s capabilities in user authentication, social networking, database management, and project application workflows.

### Key Features
1. **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage profiles.
2. **Social Posting**: Users can create, view, and interact with posts (like LinkedIn).
3. **Connections**: Users can connect with others to build a network.
4. **Profile Management**: Users can create detailed profiles with skills and project showcases.
5. **Project Listing and Showcasing**: Users can list projects to display their work.
6. **Project Opportunities**: Users can post project opportunities, and others can apply based on skills.
7. **Search by Skills**: Users can search for others based on specific skills.

The technical stack includes Django for the backend, PostgreSQL (or SQLite for simplicity) as the database, and Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for a responsive frontend. Django’s ORM and built-in authentication system will handle most backend logic.

## Key Functionalities and Behind-the-Scenes Logic

### 1. User Registration and Authentication
**Functionality**: Users can register, log in, log out, and manage their accounts. All users have the same role but can act as either project posters or candidates.

**Behind-the-Scenes Logic**:
- **Django Authentication**: Leverage `django.contrib.auth` for registration, login, and logout.
- **Custom User Model**: Extend `AbstractUser` to include fields like `bio` and `profile_picture`.
- **Profile Model**: A `Profile` model (linked via `OneToOneField` to `User`) stores additional details like `skills` (stored as a ManyToManyField or JSONField for flexibility).
- **Views**:
  - `RegisterView`: A form-based view for user sign-up, validating fields like email and password.
  - `LoginView` and `LogoutView`: Use Django’s built-in views for authentication.
- **Logic Flow**:
  - During registration, users fill out a form with username, email, password, and optional profile details.
  - After login, users are redirected to a dashboard displaying posts, connections, and projects.
  - Profile updates are handled via Django forms, with validation for file uploads (e.g., profile pictures).
- **Database**: `User` table for authentication data, `Profile` table for additional user info.

### 2. Social Posting (LinkedIn-like)
**Functionality**: Users can create posts (text or media), view a feed of posts from connections, and interact (like/comment).

**Behind-the-Scenes Logic**:
- **Models**:
  - `Post`: Fields include `user` (ForeignKey), `content`, `media_url`, `created_at`, and `likes` (ManyToManyField to User).
  - `Comment`: Fields include `post` (ForeignKey), `user` (ForeignKey), `content`, and `created_at`.
- **Views**:
  - `PostCreateView`: Form for creating posts, supporting text and media uploads.
  - `PostListView`: Displays a feed of posts from the user and their connections, ordered by `created_at`.
  - `PostDetailView`: Shows post details, comments, and a comment form.
  - `LikeView`: Toggles likes on a post, updating the `likes` field.
- **Logic Flow**:
  - Users submit posts via a form, saved to the `Post` model.
  - The feed fetches posts from the user and their connections (via `Connection` model).
  - Likes and comments are handled via AJAX for a seamless experience.
- **Database**: `Post` and `Comment` tables store post data, with foreign keys ensuring relational integrity.

### 3. Connections System
**Functionality**: Users can send, accept, or reject connection requests to build a network.

**Behind-the-Scenes Logic**:
- **Models**:
  - `Connection`: Fields include `from_user` (ForeignKey), `to_user` (ForeignKey), `status` (pending, accepted, rejected), and `created_at`.
- **Views**:
  - `ConnectionRequestView`: Sends a connection request, creating a `Connection` instance with `status=pending`.
  - `ConnectionAcceptView`: Updates `status` to `accepted`.
  - `ConnectionListView`: Displays a user’s connections and pending requests.
- **Logic Flow**:
  - A user sends a connection request, creating a `Connection` record.
  - The recipient sees pending requests and can accept/reject them, updating the `status`.
  - Accepted connections allow users to see each other’s posts in the feed.
- **Database**: `Connection` table manages relationships, with unique constraints to prevent duplicate requests.

### 4. Profile Management
**Functionality**: Users can create and update profiles with details like bio, skills, and project showcases.

**Behind-the-Scenes Logic**:
- **Models**:
  - `Profile`: Fields include `user` (OneToOneField), `bio`, `skills` (ManyToManyField to a `Skill` model), `profile_picture`, and `portfolio_url`.
  - `Skill`: A simple model with a `name` field to store skills (e.g., Python, Django).
- **Views**:
  - `ProfileUpdateView`: Form for updating profile details, including skills and portfolio.
  - `ProfileDetailView`: Displays a user’s profile, including skills and showcased projects.
- **Logic Flow**:
  - Users edit their profiles via a form, updating the `Profile` model.
  - Skills are selected from a predefined `Skill` list or added dynamically.
  - The profile view fetches related projects for display.
- **Database**: `Profile` and `Skill` tables, with a many-to-many relationship for skills.

### 5. Project Listing and Showcasing
**Functionality**: Users can list projects to showcase their work (e.g., portfolio projects).

**Behind-the-Scenes Logic**:
- **Models**:
  - `ShowcaseProject`: Fields include `user` (ForeignKey), `title`, `description`, `media_url`, `created_at`, and `skills` (ManyToManyField).
- **Views**:
  - `ShowcaseProjectCreateView`: Form for adding projects with details and media.
  - `ShowcaseProjectListView`: Displays a user’s projects on their profile.
- **Logic Flow**:
  - Users create showcase projects via a form, saved to the `ShowcaseProject` model.
  - Projects are displayed on the user’s profile, with optional filters by skills.
- **Database**: `ShowcaseProject` table stores project data, linked to users and skills.

### 6. Project Opportunities and Applications
**Functionality**: Users can post project opportunities requiring candidates, and others can apply. The poster can accept or reject applications.

**Behind-the-Scenes Logic**:
- **Models**:
  - `ProjectOpportunity`: Fields include `user` (ForeignKey), `title`, `description`, `budget`, `deadline`, `required_skills` (ManyToManyField), and `status` (open, in-progress, closed).
  - `Application`: Fields include `project` (ForeignKey), `applicant` (ForeignKey), `proposal`, `status` (pending, accepted, rejected), and `applied_at`.
- **Views**:
  - `ProjectOpportunityCreateView`: Form for posting project opportunities.
  - `ProjectOpportunityListView`: Displays open projects with filters by skills or budget.
  - `ApplicationCreateView`: Allows users to apply with a proposal.
  - `ApplicationManageView`: Enables the project poster to accept/reject applications.
- **Logic Flow**:
  - A user posts a project opportunity, saved to the `ProjectOpportunity` model.
  - Other users browse projects and submit applications, creating `Application` records.
  - The project poster reviews applications, updating `status` and notifying applicants.
  - Accepted applicants can proceed with project work (tracked via status updates).
- **Database**: `ProjectOpportunity` and `Application` tables manage project and application data.

### 7. Search by Skills
**Functionality**: Users can search for other users based on skills to find potential collaborators or candidates.

**Behind-the-Scenes Logic**:
- **Views**:
  - `SkillSearchView`: A form-based view that queries the `Profile` model for users with specific skills.
- **Logic Flow**:
  - Users enter skills in a search form, which queries the `Profile.skills` ManyToManyField.
  - Results display user profiles with matching skills, including their showcased projects.
  - Django’s `Q` objects or full-text search (e.g., PostgreSQL’s `tsvector`) can enhance search functionality.
- **Database**: Leverage the `Skill` and `Profile` tables for efficient querying.
